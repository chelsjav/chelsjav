## About Me
I am a graduate student pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Computational Social Science at the University of California, Berkeley, expecting to graduate in May of 2025. I possess a strong background in social science and have gained diverse experience working with data. I approach social science and data with a global mindset that considers the interconnectedness between the two as data analysis provides the tools to identify the patterns and relationships within large datasets, allowing insights into human behavior and social experiences.

My experience with data began with collection and assessment efforts aimed at identifying and prioritizing interventions to support youth success, contributing to community improvement initiatives. Since then, I have focused on analyzing and developing streamlined reports that enhance performance and optimize workflow efficiency. I am committed to continuous learning, which has led me to develop skills in Python, R, and various data visualization tools, enabling me to transform complex data into clear and impactful actionable insights.

As I proceed academically, I am seeking opportunities for professional growth that will allow me to apply my skills and knowledge in real-world situations.
